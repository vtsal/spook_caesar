    Architecture description:
        Implementation of Spook 128su512v1, with n=128, r=256, c=256, and tau=128. Basic iterative architecture with respect to TLS encryption and decryption, where 1 round of the TLS permutation is executed in 1 clock cycle, or 12 cycles per TLS.  However, reuse of TLS primitives (e.g., S-Box, L-Box, and round constants) results in 1 Shadow-512 permutation executing in 144 clock cycles. 
        
    Key setup time:
        0

    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        169 + Na*145 + Nm*145

    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        169 + Na*145 + Nm*145

    Non-default generic settings:
        G_W = 32
        G_SW = 32
